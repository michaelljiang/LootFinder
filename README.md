# LootFinder

LootFinder is a web application designed to help users find and sell cheap items ("loots") in their local area. Buyers can browse a map to discover nearby deals, while sellers can list items they want to sell.

## App Type and Tech Stack

**App Type:** Location-based web application  
**Tech Stack:** Vite, Vue.js, Firebase, Vercel

We chose this stack because itâ€™s simple and gets the job done. Vite is fast for development, Vue.js makes building the UI easy, Firebase handles the backend like auth and data storage, and Vercel simplifies deployment.
