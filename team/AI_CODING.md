# Michael:
- Used Github Copilot to try and debug problem with Google Maps Vue wrapper.
- Copilot couldn't understand or didn't know the syntax for the specific wrapper and gave solutions that didn't work with our tech stack.
- Some of the solutions were entirely incorrect or would compile but no solve the problem.
- The problem ended up being a formatting issue, which Copilot couldn't detect.

# Max:
- Used ChatGPT to experiment and debug styling.
- The tool worked well and I was able to adjust the styling to my liking after a bit of querying and testing.
- I will use it in the future for the same purpose and for debugging.
- I had to test if the AI output was genuine but eventually was able to elicit a response and edit it to get what I wanted.

# Awin:
- Used ChatGPT to format search page and debug issues
- It did format it in a visually pleasing way but required further instructions to properly give me a version that was consistent with original instructions.
- The solution was partially correct with me having to manually edit the rest of the code.
- I will probably use ChatGPT in the future as a starting point for what kind of formatting that I would like.

# Braden:
- Used ChatGPT to help me design and style the frontend UI for our messaging feature.
- It came up with a pretty decent starting design, although there were some parts of it that I didn't really like.
- It was very useful as it gave me a starting point that I could work off of and personalize to my liking. I can definitely see myself using it again in this way, especially when I have no clue how I want to design something and when I need some inspiration.
- In order to ensure the ouput was satisfactory, I manually changed some things myself, and I also gave it more directions until it produced me something that I liked/desired.

# Ajay:
- I used ChatGPT, and Github Copilot to implement "Mark as Sold" functionality.
- Github Copilot integrated great with VS Code, but it didn't style my component to my liking. It simply copied the styling of surrounding elements verbatim, which worked well with the button but not for the label.
- I wanted to be able to toggle between "Mark as sold" and "Mark as unsold", but I couldn't communicate that to Github Copilot even with the built-in Copilot chatbox. I copied my file to ChatGPT and it gave me a working solution, only needing minor touches to styling.

# Jonathan:
- I used Github Copilot (with OpenAI's o1 model) with to create a Vitest unit test for a frontend component
- It came up with a pretty good unit test and understood exactly what the component was trying to display
- The test was not functional right away upon running the command provided by the model, but after providing error messages, it was able to diagnose that I was missing some imports and dependencies
- I will probably use large language models for assistance with creating unit tests almost every time in the future now
