# Michael:
- Used Github Copilot to try and debug problem with Google Maps Vue wrapper.
- Copilot couldn't understand or didn't know the syntax for the specific wrapper and gave solutions that didn't work with our tech stack.
- Some of the solutions were entirely incorrect or would compile but no solve the problem.
- The problem ended up being a formatting issue, which Copilot couldn't detect.

# Max:
- Used ChatGPT to experiment and debug styling.
- The tool worked well and I was able to adjust the styling to my liking after a bit of querying and testing.
- I will use it in the future for the same purpose and for debugging.
- I had to test if the AI output was genuine but eventually was able to elicit a response and edit it to get what I wanted. 

# Ajay:
- I used ChatGPT, and Github Copilot to implement "Mark as Sold" functionality.
- Github Copilot integrated great with VS Code, but it didn't style my component to my liking. It simply copied the styling of surrounding elements verbatim, which worked well with the button but not for the label.
- I wanted to be able to toggle between "Mark as sold" and "Mark as unsold", but I couldn't communicate that to Github Copilot even with the built-in Copilot chatbox. I copied my file to ChatGPT and it gave me a working solution, only needing minor touches to styling.
