# Michael:
- Used Github Copilot to try and debug problem with Google Maps Vue wrapper.
- Copilot couldn't understand or didn't know the syntax for the specific wrapper and gave solutions that didn't work with our tech stack.
- Some of the solutions were entirely incorrect or would compile but no solve the problem.
- The problem ended up being a formatting issue, which Copilot couldn't detect.

# Max:
- Used ChatGPT to experiment and debug styling.
- The tool worked well and I was able to adjust the styling to my liking after a bit of querying and testing.
- I will use it in the future for the same purpose and for debugging.
- I had to test if the AI output was genuine but eventually was able to elicit a response and edit it to get what I wanted.
