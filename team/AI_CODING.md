# Michael:
- Used Github Copilot to try and debug problem with Google Maps Vue wrapper.
- Copilot couldn't understand or didn't know the syntax for the specific wrapper and gave solutions that didn't work with our tech stack.
- Some of the solutions were entirely incorrect or would compile but no solve the problem.
- The problem ended up being a formatting issue, which Copilot couldn't detect.

# Max:
- Used ChatGPT to experiment and debug styling.
- The tool worked well and I was able to adjust the styling to my liking after a bit of querying and testing.
- I will use it in the future for the same purpose and for debugging.
- I had to test if the AI output was genuine but eventually was able to elicit a response and edit it to get what I wanted.

# Awin:
- Used ChatGPT to format search page and debug issues
- It did format it in a visually pleasing way but required further instructions to properly give me a version that was consistent with original instructions.
- The solution was partially correct with me having to manually edit the rest of the code.
- I will probably use ChatGPT in the future as a starting point for what kind of formatting that I would like.

# Braden:
- Used ChatGPT to help me design and style the frontend UI for our messaging feature.
- It came up with a pretty decent starting design, although there were some parts of it that I didn't really like.
- It was very useful as it gave me a starting point that I could work off of and personalize to my liking. I can definitely see myself using it again in this way, especially when I have no clue how I want to design something and when I need some inspiration.
- In order to ensure the ouput was satisfactory, I manually changed some things myself, and I also gave it more directions until it produced me something that I liked/desired.
