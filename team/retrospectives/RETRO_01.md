## Retro Assessment

I started by asking everyone on the team what they are currently working on and how that is going. I do this to potentially spark more ideas on how the team has been doing and what should change. Then, I started the start/stop/continue template. I ask each team member what they think about what we should start/stop/continue doing.

The retrospective went well in my opinion, everyone contributed valuable insights and we have a very good idea of what we should be doing going forward.

For the next person, I would advise following the start/stop/continue template because that worked well this retrospective.

## Experiment/Change

We are experimenting with who will review the pull requests. Last week we had a system that people who have time will just review the changes but it did not work well. So this week the each person will have 2 designated members who will review their pull requests, and they will ping them on slack when the do a pull request so that they know to review it. 
After experimenting with it, our tickets that are awaiting review decreased significantly and the speed is faster too, so we will be continuing this change.
